This repository is where my dynamic react based portfolio site about me and my work is hosted with GitHub pages.

This site is based on many popular portfolio templates and themes/but stylied more to allow for features not possible without react and javascript. Components and items were designed with dynamic template building in mind. If I could create components with repeatability but high cusomization in mind then I could seperate the design from the data.

## Features

- This react site utilizes `MUI` and `Bootstrap` for easy style management and creation, uses react reccomended coding syntax, and react best practices.

- Code is organized by sites with their components and features, utelizes organized `ui` structures, routes navigation with `react-router` and handling for wrong addresses, and more.

- Almost all Infomation present on the website is not hard coded, and is actually coded into javaScript objects stored in the `data` folder. When loading on screen items the given data is `mapped` as the displayed components, dynamically displaying content to the user.
