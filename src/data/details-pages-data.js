However, because of how in-depth some items were getting, I wanted to reduce the chances of error and increase efficiency. So I made several tools to help, like an admin panel for adding items to Firebase, and an editing tool with Python to further reduce the file sizes of videos specifically for step videos.

Some of the features he needed included saving copies and starting new workbooks for tax purposes. While Excel doesn’t offer a built-in log feature, it had everything I needed to build a custom suite of automation tools to handle that and more. I created a dashboard where he could manage every part of the workbook. He could save PDF copies of the sheet, clear the workbook, or do both at once using multiple action buttons. He could even change the file’s date using a text input, though it would also auto-recalculate the date if left blank. By following similar principles across every feature, the workbook became fully equipped in no time. He’s been using it ever since and has saved countless hours in his workflow."

I needed to build an infinitely scrolling carousel with swiping actions that could also add new items, all while keeping things seamless. I found some examples and tried integrating them, but I kept running into problems.

But by limiting each array to around a max of four items, performance improved significantly. With that many swipe states, I even introduced tracking values that let me control every part of the carousel.
